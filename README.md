## 🧠 About Me

- 🎯 Columbia sophomore focused on applied ML end-to-end design, training, evaluating, and deploying models across vision, text, audio, and tabular data.
- 🚀 Recent work includes a PyTorch DQN that learns Snake via self-play, an OpenCV-based MacOS FaceID that trains in seconds without GPUs, and an agentic Columbia RAG assistant.
- 🧠 Skills in Python, C++, Java, React, C, Bash, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Langchain, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas.
- 🎓 B.S. in Computer Science, Columbia University in the City of New York, Expected Graduation May 2028.

## 📱 Projects

| Project | Description | Tech Stack |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **[FaceGuard] (github.com/HassamGani/FaceGuard)** | Invented a lightweight facial recognition security software that quickly trains on owner’s face within 6 seconds without GPUs. | Python, OpenCV, Bash |
| **[SmartSnake] (github.com/HassamGani/SmartSnake)** | Built a reinforcement learning agent in PyTorch that plays Snake, with a two-layer network using 11 inputs, 256 hidden units, and 3 outputs. | Python, PyTorch, Pygame |
| **[myHomer] (hassamgani.com/projects#myhomer)** | Developed a campus-aware chatbot that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation over 470,944 chunks of embedded Columbia resources. | Python, Langchain, ChromaDB |
| **[cpyAnalyzer] (github.com/wunused/python-ast)** | Pickle-based Machine Learning models contain high cybersecurity risks — so I built this analyzer to mitigate them. | Python, AST |

---

## 🏆 Awards & Achievements

- Contributed to generating policies that correctly loaded 79.8% of benign pickle-based ML models while rejecting 100% of malicious ones by developing cpyAnalyzer.

---

## 📚 Publications

- Credited in preliminary draft of forthcoming research paper on practical use and vulnerability testing of custom-made pickle-based models.
